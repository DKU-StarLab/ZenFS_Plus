We\textquotesingle{}d love to accept your code patches! However, before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

\subsection*{Contributor License Agreements}

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement as appropriate.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If you are an individual writing original source code and you\textquotesingle{}re sure you own the intellectual property, then sign an \href{https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual}{\texttt{ individual C\+LA}}.
\item If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then sign a \href{https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate}{\texttt{ corporate C\+LA}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate C\+LA and instructions for how to sign and return it.

\subsection*{Submitting a Patch}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Sign the contributors license agreement above.
\item Decide which code you want to submit. A submission should be a set of changes that addresses one issue in the \href{https://github.com/google/leveldb/issues}{\texttt{ issue tracker}}. Please don\textquotesingle{}t mix more than one logical change per submission, because it makes the history hard to follow. If you want to make a change (e.\+g. add a sample or feature) that doesn\textquotesingle{}t have a corresponding issue in the issue tracker, please create one.
\item {\bfseries{Submitting}}\+: When you are ready to submit, send us a Pull Request. Be sure to include the issue number you fixed and the name you used to sign the C\+LA.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{Writing Code}

If your contribution contains code, please make sure that it follows \href{http://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html}{\texttt{ the style guide}}. Otherwise we will have to ask you to make changes, and that\textquotesingle{}s no fun for anyone.
